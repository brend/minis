# minis
Small projects, they're really tiny.

## Philosophy

To actually finish a hobby project for once, each of these minis must only obey one rule: It must be done within one day.

## Ideas for future minis

- 🐎 **Jumping game**: Pressing the button makes the character jump over obstacles that come their way
- 🏇 **Jumping game brain**: Use my homegrown Neural Network to teach a robot how to play the game
- 🪶 **Text adventure**: Text-based game akin to Zork
