# 🚗 Minis
Small projects, they're really tiny.

## Philosophy

To actually finish a hobby project for once, each of these Minis must only obey one rule: It must be done within one day.

## Accomplished Minis

None so far. This is going great!

## Ideas for future Minis

### Games

- 🐎 **Jumping game**: Pressing the button makes the character jump over obstacles that come their way
- 🏇 **Jumping game brain**: Use my homegrown Neural Network to teach a robot how to play the game
- 🪶 **Text adventure**: Text-based game akin to Zork
